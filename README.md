## ðŸ“€ ARKAN0IDZ âš¡

**Ainâ€™t your grandmaâ€™s Arkanoid.**
This is my *pure JavaScript*, no-dependency, neon-drenched, MySpace-era inspired, Y2K brick breaker.
Built just because I can. And because boring games suck.

## ðŸŽ® Whatâ€™s inside:

* Pure **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
* Glowing **Plastic effects**, randomized brick colors
* Retro **grungy tile background**
* Y2K/2010s aesthetic fonts and vibes
* No libraries. No frameworks. No mercy.

## ðŸ“¢ Disclaimer:

Built for fun.
Break the rules. Hack the bricks. Make it your own.

If you fork this and turn it into a mobile game with pay-to-win skinsâ€¦ at least buy me a coffee.
